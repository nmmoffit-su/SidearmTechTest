## 1. What are some edge-cases you'd consider before shipping this feature?

From a CSS standpoint, one edge case I would consider is a user with a narrow viewing screen. For example, this app was built as 380px being the smallest viewing width. However in Chrome Dev Tools, I clicked through the Responsive devices, and users on a Galaxy Fold would have a difficult time navigating this site, albeit in the folded state. Simply removing the dropdown item and a few changes to the header of Section 4 would support users on this device. I think it’s an important point overall since companies are constantly creating new devices and screens to display content. 

While this is mainly a Lorem text site, I noticed that there seems to be at least a small portion of e-commerce. If it was a fully functioning site, you would need to consider issues like low stock items, out-of-stock items, discounts, and how the user interacts with these problems. For example, what happens when a user adds an item to their cart, and before they purchase the item, it runs out of stock. This is something that would happen very rarely, however, there would need to be some final check before an order is placed to ensure the item is in stock. 

## 2. Which of your skills that you expect to use in this role do you feel weren't highlighted in this project?

I didn’t find it necessary to use Vue for this project, however, it is a library I have been very interested in and learned a lot about. I understand that we are transitioning into Vue, and I think I have some strong experience using it already. I have built 2 websites using Vue, which you can check out on this GitHub, if interested. 

I also think my background at SIDEARM would give me a great head start on understanding the processes and company workflow. 

## 3. What's important for remote engineering teams to work well?

I have not been a part of an engineering team yet, however, I have been a part of a remote team for over a year now. What I’ve learned from it is clear communication is crucial. We used to be able to simply walk over to someone’s desk and talk through any issues. Now, most of our conversations are over Slack or Podio, where sending an unclear request or message can cause lots of confusion. 

Thinking more on the engineering side, I think adherence to company documentation is critical because it supplies everyone on the team with a baseline of understanding for any piece of code. This is paramount for things like reviewing code, debugging, and understanding legacy code.
